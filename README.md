# Linux-Shadow-Cracker

This script cracks linux password for a given user using bruteforce technique. If you are using **/etc/shadow** directly to crack then you need to have root privileges. If you are using a shadow formatted file taken from somewhere then you can directly crack without root privileges. For bruteforcing you also need to have dictionary.

### How to use:
1. chmod +x linshad.py
2. ./linShad.py -h
